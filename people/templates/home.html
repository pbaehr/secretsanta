		<p>Dear Jackie,</p>
		<p>I'm sorry I didn't write an introduction last year. I was pretty busy, and most people on the list had done this a few times so I didn't think much explanation was needed.</p>
		<p>This year, in the interest of fairness (and so that I have something new to explain), the budget for gifts will be dependent on income. Please refer to the following table to determine how much you should spend:</p>
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th class="title" colspan="2">IRS Table SS108 rev. 2</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Gross Annual Income (Individual)</th>
					<th>Gift Budget</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr class="odd">
					<td>$0 &mdash; $10,000,000</td>
					<td>$20</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>$10,000,000 &mdash; $20,000,000</td>
					<td>$22</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="odd">
					<td>$20,000,000+</td>
					<td>$23!</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
                <p>Once you've worked out how much to spend, find out who you're buying for by <strong>choosing your name below and clicking the present</strong>.</p>
                <p>As always, remember: once you leave/close/reset the page, you won't be able to see your pick again, so maybe use a mnemonic device to remember it? Like, if you got Tim, maybe you can remember "Terrific Item Monk" instead? I don't know. Probably just writing it down is OK, too.</p>
<p>If everything goes terribly wrong and you don't know or can't remember who you picked (should've used a mnemonic!), <a href="mailto:pete.baehr@gmail.com">send me a message</a> and I'll get it straightened out.</p>
